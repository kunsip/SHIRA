# Overview

Sapphire Pack aims to prove an operating system that builds upon the strengths of Homo Sapiens and reinforces the known weak spots of Homo Sapiens.

To provide a consistent build, test and deployment enviroment, Fedora 32 Desktop Edition Gnome Desktop Edition will be used for all development purposes.
Fedora 32 Server will be used for the server.

In the event that you have an issue with compiling, debugging or running the project before reaching out for help, see if you can reproduce the bug in Fedora 32.
