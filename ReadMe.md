# Overview
Extremely Long Term, Environmentally and Individually Considerate Software to keep you running while doing socially optimal harm to the planet. AKA The Project.

# Goals

Simplicity
    Unlike other systems, this system is designed from the ground up to be easy, understandable for the entity using it. NOT for the designers.
Careability
    Caring for the entity that is using The Project so that the entity feels safe.
Longevity     
    User should not worry about The Project from disappearing. Sapphire Pack will design a pricing strategy to make sure that The Project remains operational for the forseeable future.
