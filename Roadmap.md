             Mentality of Select and Action where all changes are automatically saved.
    - ZUI for User's Notes
        Access Calender
        Access Tasks
        Access Email
        Create Notes

        ZUI setup

        Bottom bar of screen contains options to switch activity
        
        Top bar of screen contains activity specific controls

    
    Bottom Row Three Buttons
 
    Intention (Long Press, show Timeline of last few intentions)
        When in Intention (Simple Screen with Search Bar)
    Notes (Long Press, show Heatmap of last acccessed Notes)
        When in Notes (ZUI, calling notes to reduce user acroynm fatigue)
    Activity (Long Press, show Timeline)
        When in Activity

    This bar slides down to take up half of it's space and reduces to 30% opacity to help user work, same with topbar. Touching either brings both back fully onto screen.
