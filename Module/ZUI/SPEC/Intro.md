#Why
	ZUI provides an ability to not enforce any particular hierarchy on a user and helps hide the file system, concept of files, folders and such. 
#Stakeholders
	The stakeholders for this module are:
		- Users (They must have something that is so good it's worth learning a new paradigm just to adapt)
#Resources
	SapphirePack will use the following resources when creating the ZUI
		1) The Humane Interface by Jef Raskin
		2) The Promise of zoomable user interfaces by Benjamin B. Bederson
#Costs
	The cost will likely be:
		- 10 hours designing integration with external apps, terminology and control flow
		- 25 hours designing basic panning and zooming capabilities for both mobile and desktop
		- 30 hours integrating everything and running tests
	So overall the cost is 65 hours to design the ZUI. Which will take approximately 3 weeks and should be done by August 9th. 
#Benefits
	Providing a well thought out environment that allows near infinite storage of information (2^128 by 2^128 so around 1.1579209e+77 discrete pieces of knowledge)
	Beginning to abstract away the concept of applications, networked content, sites.
	Making sharing and social group work much easier
