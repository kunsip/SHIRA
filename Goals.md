SHIRA aims to provide three things:

- Simplicity
    Unlike other systems, this system is designed from the ground up to be easy, understandable for the entity using it. NOT for the designers of SHIRA.
- Careability
    Caring for the entity that is using SHIRA so that the entity feels safe using SHIRA.
- Longevity     
    User should not worry about SHIRA disappearing. Sapphire Pack will design a pricing strategy to make sure that SHIRA remains operational for the forseeable future.
